    <h1>Why did I create this application?</h1>
    <p>
      A study conducted by Burbio estimates that "52% of students wil go to school virtually only [for the Fall 2020 semester]." This is a problem, according to the CDC, extended school closure contributes to learning loss and stunts social and emotional development. School is important, but we must open safely. My web application aims to help schools safely reopen using a CDC recommended method called "cohorting."

    <h1>Why elementary school students?</h1>
    <p>
        First, studies show that students younger than 10 years olds are less likely to transmit and spread the virus. Second, younger children are very much in need of the social aspect that schools provide. Lastly, older students are usually more independent. Allowing elementary age students to have some time at school could alleviate parent guardian stress.

    <h1>What is cohorting? Why use it?</h1>
    <p>
      Cohorting is a CDC recommended method where students are divided into smaller groups that interact and learn together (while following CDC guidlines of social distancing, hand washing etc.) throughout the day.
      <br>
      This allows for easier contact tracing. If one student tests positive for COVID-19, only the studens in the cohort and the teacher need to quarantine rather than the whole school.The smaller groups also means easier class regulation. Each cohort can be assigned to one teacher. This consistency of teacher is scientifically proven to be beneficial.

    <h1>What is "Class Capacity"?</h1>
    <p>
      The percent of students that can come to school.
      <br>
      <b>50%</b> means half of the school population can come to school <i>each day</i> which means that each student can come to school <b>twice</b> a week.
      <br>
      <b>25%</b> means a quarter of the school population can come to school <i>each day</i> which means that each student can come to school <b>once</b> a week.
    </p>

    <h1>Why is Wednesday open?</h1>
    <p>
      Study shows that priority should be given to students in need (ex. disabled students, low income students, students with two parent guardians that are essential workers). That off day can be used to provide extra support for them. It can also be used as a school-wide cleaning day
